Description:
This project was built to assign TA's to labs based on TA schedule preferences and availability. 
The assignments are created using evolutionary computation and was origionally developed for DS3500: Advanced Programing With Data (Dr. John Rachlin) which I took in May-July 2025. 
After creating a python based project with testing and profiling, I decided to expand the project as a personal goal to learn web development and docker. 
I used docker, html, javascript, and CSS to design a full stack project that runs locally on the machine and can be ran easily on different enviroments. 

Instructions:
To run the project, open the directory to my portfolio and using terminal enter: docker compose up -d. 
Alternativly, use the provided rebuild.sh which will ensure the local ports are not already in use by another docker project. 

Potential Errors:
If need be, change your local port in docker-compose.yml if port 3000 or 80 are already in use.
