TA Assignments 
-----------------
Description:
This project was built to assign TA's to labs based on TA schedule preferences and availability. 
The assignments are created using evolutionary computation and was originally developed for DS3500: Advanced Programing With Data (Dr. John Rachlin) which I took in May-July 2025. 
After creating a python based project with testing and profiling, I decided to expand the project as a personal goal to learn web development and docker. 
I used docker, html, javascript, and CSS to design a full stack project that runs locally on the machine and can be run easily on different environments. 

Instructions:
To run the project, open the directory to my portfolio and using terminal enter: docker compose up -d. 
Alternatively, use the provided rebuild.sh which will ensure the local ports are not already in use by another docker project. 

Potential Errors:
If need be, change your local port in docker-compose.yml if port 3000 or 80 are already in use.

Panel
--------
Description:
This project uses panel, my own api, and a large csv file of used car data in order to generate an interactive sankey and lineplot visualization hosted locally through panel. The dashboard allows for custom visualizations in order to visualize how a numeric value relates to 3 other variables.

Instructions:
Run the panel_car.py file while making sure to have all requirements on your environment.

This project creates an environment animation using arrays to demonstrate population relationships between foxes and rabbits. After running the simulation, a printed graph displays the relationship between foxes and rabbits.
